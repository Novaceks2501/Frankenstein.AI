# Frankenstein.AI
Project Name: ArchimedesXXIII
Named after the great Mathematician and the Number 23.

This will be my first attempt to building a Artificial Intelligence Chatbot. 

For the hardware, I will be using a $3200.00 custom-built gaming pc:
- Ryzen 7 5700X 8-Core 
- Radeon RX GB Video Card
- ASROCK Motherboard
- 32 GB RAM
- Couple of Solid State Drives

I'll be working mainly with Windows 11 Pro. 

Within it a VirtualBox that has MX Linux 23.1 as the workstation to create the AI chatbot:
 a) Jupiter Notebook 
 b) TensorFlow 
 c) Kera or maybe Rasa
 d) IBM Watson API

The expected completion date is September 20th 2024

- Wish me luck üôè
